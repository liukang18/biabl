## UCSD Research Project

We are nearing completion on data gathering.  We have approximately 15 more MRI scans that have to be run and sent to us.  At this point in time, we have 237 scans and we have a few that still need quality checks and that is being done by Chris Finuf and Josh Tate.  Once the database is completed, we will proceed with the volumetric analyses using the Aseg and Aparc Files and Dawn-Marie will be in charge of that Excel spreadsheet and running the analysis and Chris Finuf and Josh Tate will be involved in the QDEQQ analyses, specifically looking at cortical volume, cortical thickness and gyrification.  Zachary Christensen will be applying an ANTs template to this dataset once completed and he will oversee the comparisons between FreeSurfer and ANTS in terms of which technique may be the most robust.

This will be updated at the next lab meeting in February.

The different researcher  that are on the UCSD project will be networked, linking through the lab webpage and posting any issues, problems, changes and providing documentation of what is done. Basic record keeping will be kept in each lab book. Next lab meeting we will focus on the 'Mild Injury Outcome Study' (MIOS).

# Wed Feb 10 11:00:00 MST 2016

Brain Imaging and Behavior Staff met today.  The UCSD update is that Chris and Josh have been working on the last batch of 30 cases.  They have done their quality assurance and edits and are waiting for the last bit of output to make the proper comparison.  

The MIOS project is moving along excellently.  Dr. Goodrich-Hunsaker presented initial findings at INS and is working on a Methods paper.  Dr. Hunsaker also demonstrated how all of the various updates with MIOS, including code that is being used, is being saved on the webpage.

There was further discussion about lab books and note taking with the webpage coming together, most of what will happen in the lab will occur via communication and interaction through the webpage.  Dawn-Marie showed how the â€œForum" tab on the webpage could be accessed and used and where data and note sharing can take place and occur.  Part of the discussion centered on the fact that there still needs to be some documentation in the hard copy left in the book, but most of that can merely be referenced back to what is being done electronically on the webpage.

There was further discussion about other things to go on the webpage, including articles and a link to the National Library of Medicine (Pubmed.com).  Kaylee will be in charge of linking articles with the National Library of Medicine so that at least individuals can click on the webpage and it will take them to an abstract.  Kaylee is also going to be in charge of getting pictures and we discussed having a lab meeting in April over at the Skyroom and take a group picture of all of us together.

We are on track to finish all of the data analyses and data acquisition for the UCSD study by June.

# Thu Mar 10 13:00:00 MDT 2016

## Brain Imaging and Behavior Lab Meeting:

The first item of discussion centered on the UCSD project.  Dawn-Marie
provided an excellent, detailed and thorough summary of the cases so far in
this project.  There will be ultimately 332 subjects and the final ones will
be imaged by the end of this month.  With regards to initial participants
recruited into the study, it looks like there will be somewhere in the
neighborhood of 3 individuals with motor vehicle accident, 20 individuals
with recreational injuries, 21 with slip and fall, and 39 in the
sports-related concussion group where MRI was not obtained.  Our Sports
Medicine and Arthroscopy Review manuscript has been accepted for publication
pending some minor revisions and hopefully I will be able to get that done
over the weekend.  

Josh provided an update on the FreeSurfer analyses that he and Chris Finuf
are doing.  They will develop a spreadsheet in Excel to report volumetric
findings and once the volumetric findings are done, they will begin QDEC
analyses.  The first QDEC analyses will be simply comparing the TBI kids to
those with OI, controlling for age and sex.  The next analyses will be by
category (please see the "summary by injury" file that Dawn-Marie has
created).  These additional QDEC analyses will be comparing the TBI kids
with OI kids, by each category (i.e. motor vehicle accident, recreational,
slip and fall, and sports-related).

Discussion then turned to MIOS and at this point, Dr. Goodrich-Hunsaker is
focusing on data analysis and manuscript preparation for a 'Methods' paper
on this particular dataset.  Tracy indicated that some additional disks have
come in and they will be processed and brought into the system.  Zach is
wrapping up the UCSD dataset and pipeline for ANTs.  His role is to have
that completed by the time that he heads off to medical school.

Discussion then turned to the repeat scan analyses that Trevor is running
and Chris Cutler provided an update on the initial repeat scanning which has
been done.  We are still awaiting IRB approval but once that is completed,
then that project will move forward.  We are still waiting to hear decisions
on the NIH submissions for the SBIR project and also feedback on the
longitudinal autism project. We discussed Level 3 training for both Chris C.
and Dawn-Marie. This will become important as HYBOBI-2gets started and
recruitment begins.  Depending on how things play out with other grant
proposals that are being reviewed, Dawn-Marie may begin coordinating
HYBOBI-2 over the Summer.

Discussion turned to Spring-Summer schedules with medical school and
graduate schools stealing away students along with marriages. Therefore, a
90 minute lecture ensued on the penultimate importance of putting lab goals
as #1 in everyone's life --- well, maybe this was NOT discussed, but we did
look at deadlines, staff turnover, vacations and funding for UCSD completion
as the top priority.
