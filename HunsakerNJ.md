## UCSD Research Project

We are nearing completion on data gathering.  We have approximately 15 more MRI scans that have to be run and sent to us.  At this point in time, we have 237 scans and we have a few that still need quality checks and that is being done by Chris Finuf and Josh Tate.  Once the database is completed, we will proceed with the volumetric analyses using the Aseg and Aparc Files and Dawn-Marie will be in charge of that Excel spreadsheet and running the analysis and Chris Finuf and Josh Tate will be involved in the QDEQQ analyses, specifically looking at cortical volume, cortical thickness and gyrification.  Zachary Christensen will be applying an ANTs template to this dataset once completed and he will oversee the comparisons between FreeSurfer and ANTS in terms of which technique may be the most robust.

This will be updated at the next lab meeting in February.

The different researcher  that are on the UCSD project will be networked, linking through the lab webpage and posting any issues, problems, changes and providing documentation of what is done. Basic record keeping will be kept in each lab book. Next lab meeting we will focus on the 'Mild Injury Outcome Study' (MIOS).

# Wed Feb 10 11:00:00 MST 2016

Brain Imaging and Behavior Staff met today.  The UCSD update is that Chris and Josh have been working on the last batch of 30 cases.  They have done their quality assurance and edits and are waiting for the last bit of output to make the proper comparison.  

The MIOS project is moving along excellently.  Dr. Goodrich-Hunsaker presented initial findings at INS and is working on a Methods paper.  Dr. Hunsaker also demonstrated how all of the various updates with MIOS, including code that is being used, is being saved on the webpage.

There was further discussion about lab books and note taking with the webpage coming together, most of what will happen in the lab will occur via communication and interaction through the webpage.  Dawn-Marie showed how the â€œForum" tab on the webpage could be accessed and used and where data and note sharing can take place and occur.  Part of the discussion centered on the fact that there still needs to be some documentation in the hard copy left in the book, but most of that can merely be referenced back to what is being done electronically on the webpage.

There was further discussion about other things to go on the webpage, including articles and a link to the National Library of Medicine (Pubmed.com).  Kaylee will be in charge of linking articles with the National Library of Medicine so that at least individuals can click on the webpage and it will take them to an abstract.  Kaylee is also going to be in charge of getting pictures and we discussed having a lab meeting in April over at the Skyroom and take a group picture of all of us together.

We are on track to finish all of the data analyses and data acquisition for the UCSD study by June.

    Updated script to include an if-statement to look check for existing files. If the participant has already be processed, then skip the step. This is important when trying to add new participants as I am doing now.
